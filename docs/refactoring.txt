Class-level Refactoring Report
==========

For each refactoring opportunity , please provide the following information:
    - where the issue is
    - what SOLID principle (if any) are violated
    - whether a class implementation or class interface refactoring
      is needed
    - a brief description of each issue
    - how to fix the issue

CLASS-LEVEL REFACTORING IMPLEMENTED

Refactoring 0:
  Location: User.java
	SOLID principle: Single Responsibility Principle
	class implementation or class interface: User.java
	Cause: User handles relationships between user, this violates the Single Responsibility Principle principal as
	User is handling both User creation and storage, and managing the relationship functions between the Users
	Fix: refactor relationship functions (i.e friending a user and associated functions) into their own classes.

Refactoring 1:
  Location:
	SOLID principle:
	class implementation or class interface:
	Cause:

CLASS-LEVEL REFACTORING SUGGESTED BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED

Refactoring 2:
  Location: FriendMaker.java
	SOLID principle:Single Responsibility Principle
	class implementation or class interface: implement Abstract relationshipMaker class and followerMaker Class
	Cause: FriendMaker has two responsibilities: handling friend functions and follow functions
	Fix: adding and abstract super class for both the friend functions and the follow functions

Refactoring 3:
