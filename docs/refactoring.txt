Class-level Refactoring Report
==========

For each refactoring opportunity , please provide the following information:
    - where the issue is
    - what SOLID principle (if any) are violated
    - whether a class implementation or class interface refactoring
      is needed
    - a brief description of each issue
    - how to fix the issue

CLASS-LEVEL REFACTORING IMPLEMENTED

Refactoring 0:
  Location:
	SOLID principle: Open/Close
	class implementation or class interface: User.java
	Cause: User handles relationships between user, this violates the open/closed principal as we want to add
	more types in the future.
	Fix: refactor relationship functions (i.e friending a user and associated functions) into their own classes

Refactoring 1:
  Location:
	SOLID principle:
